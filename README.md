# Parnumation

**Parnumation** (short for "Pargodungan Numbered Notation") is a custom font created by **Rikardo Lumbantobing** in 2014 using [Fontographer](https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontographer/) and [High-Logic FontCreator](https://www.high-logic.com/font-editor/fontcreator). This font transforms regular text input into numbered notation, making it particularly useful for writing music scores in word processors such as Microsoft Word. Writing music with this font has become a popular method for creating clean and easy-to-produce numbered notation scores. For more details about the Parnumation font, you can visit Rikardo's blog [here](https://gnibot.blogspot.com/2014/07/parnumation-3.html).

## Project Overview

As a regular user of the Parnumation font, I have personally experienced its utility and potential. With this project, I aim to expand the functionality of Parnumation beyond its current capabilities. Previously, I made minor modifications to create **Parnumation 3.1**, which introduced single-line markings for half notes (as opposed to the extended line markings used for double notes in Parnumation 3.0). Now, I plan to take the development further by implementing additional features and tools.

## Goals and Features

This project seeks to enhance the Parnumation font and its usability through the following planned features:

1. **Convert Numbered Notation to MIDI**  
   Develop a tool to automatically convert music scores written with Parnumation notation into MIDI files.

2. **Convert MIDI to Parnumation Notation**  
   Create a feature that generates Parnumation-style notation from single-voice MIDI files.

3. **Export to PDF**  
   Allow users to export scores to PDF format with customizable styles for the numbered notation.

## Why Parnumation?

Numbered notation has long been a valuable system for music transcription, particularly in regions where this method is prevalent. Parnumation makes it easy to write music scores with a standard word processor, offering a balance of simplicity and elegance. With the planned tools, Parnumation will evolve into a more versatile and user-friendly system for music notation and editing.
